## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software. 
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
1.Purpose & Functionality – This software is designed to simulate real-world hiring processes, allowing applicants to interact with a digital selection system. It helps both recruiters and candidates practice and refine their decision-making.

2.Core Features – It may include modules like AI-driven applicant assessment, automated resume screening, skill-based evaluations, and real-time interview simulations to mimic HR selection processes.

3.User Interaction – Candidates can experience a simulated hiring environment, receiving feedback on their applications, while recruiters can test different selection criteria for efficient hiring.

4.Technology Stack – Likely to involve web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (for frontend), Node.js/Python (for backend), and databases like MySQL/MongoDB to manage applicant data.

5.Impact & Benefits – Helps in reducing bias in hiring, improving recruitment efficiency, and providing a fair platform for job seekers to understand and enhance their selection chances.

## Technology Stack
1.Frontend (User Interface) – Built using React.js/Angular for an interactive experience, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for responsiveness.

2.Backend & Database – Uses Node.js with Express / Python with Flask or Django for API development, and MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB for storing user data.

3.AI & Cloud Deployment – Integrates AI/ML (TensorFlow/PyTorch) for applicant ranking & resume screening, and deploys on AWS/Azure/GCP for scalability.
